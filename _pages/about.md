## Use This Template

**Feel free to star ‚≠ê and fork üç¥ this website for your own use!** 

You're welcome to customize it with your own information and make it your personal academic portfolio. The entire codebase is open source and available on GitHub at: [https://github.com/HabibZRK/academic_profile](https://github.com/HabibZRK/academic_profile)

If this repository gains attention and there's community interest, I plan to create an abstracted fork that would make it even easier to customize with your own information‚Äîthink of it as a more user-friendly template version.
