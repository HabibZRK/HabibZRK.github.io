# Welcome to My Personal Website  

I‚Äôm **Habib Zreik** ‚Äî a mechanical and mechatronics engineer who loves building, coding, and figuring out how complex systems fit together. What really excites me is seeing the bigger picture, connecting ideas across fields, and collaborating with people from all kinds of backgrounds to create solutions that are both practical and innovative. Beyond engineering, I‚Äôve always been drawn to community, culture, and volunteering ‚Äî the human side of knowledge that keeps ideas alive and shared.  

## A Lifelong Learner  

My educational journey reflects a curiosity that spans multiple disciplines:  

- ‚è≥ **M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering (specialization in Mechatronics)** ‚Äî [University of Duisburg-Essen](https://www.uni-due.de/), 2023 ‚Äì present (*thesis in progress*)  
- üéì **Associate Degree in Computer Science** ‚Äî [University of the People](https://www.uopeople.edu/), 2023  
- ‚è≥ **MBA in Business Administration** ‚Äî [Syrian Virtual University](https://www.svuonline.org/en), 2021 ‚Äì present (*thesis pending*)  
- üéì **B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering** ‚Äî [Damascus University](https://www.damascusuniversity.edu.sy/index.php?lang=2), 2020  

This mix of studies has shaped how I approach engineering: balancing technical precision with big-picture thinking and always asking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù  

## Current Focus  

My work and studies are currently divided between two main pursuits. At [**DST e.V.**](https://www.dst-org.de/), I‚Äôm programming, researching, and documenting robotics projects such as [*CoboTank*](https://cobotank.de/), focusing on control systems, human‚Äìmachine interfaces, and practical deployment. Alongside this, I continue preparing for my master‚Äôs in Mechatronics at [University of Duisburg-Essen](https://www.uni-due.de/), advancing my academic research and technical expertise in parallel with DST projects.  

## What Drives My Work  

**üîß Research & Robotics**  
I spend my days at DST contributing to maritime robotics and automation projects, developing software, and ensuring robotic systems are both reliable and intuitive.  

**üìö Sharing Knowledge**  
Since 2019, I‚Äôve been part of **Bayt Al-Hikma 2.0** (Ideas Beyond Borders), translating and adapting technical and cultural content into Arabic. From mechanical engineering and sustainability to methodology and the history of ideas, I help make knowledge accessible to millions across the Middle East.  

**‚úçÔ∏è Writing & Documentation**  
Clear communication is key to everything I do. Whether I‚Äôm creating Git workflows for engineering teams, writing guides for robotics projects, or contributing to research publications, I aim to make complex ideas understandable and useful.  

## Areas of Expertise  

- **Mechanical & Mechatronic Engineering**: from classical mechanics to robotics and automation  
- **Programming**: C++, Python, ROS2  
- **Translation**: English ‚Üî Arabic technical, academic, and cultural works  
- **Research & Documentation**: scientific methodology, project development, technical writing  

## Beyond Engineering  

Alongside my technical and academic journey, I‚Äôve been deeply involved in cultural initiatives that shaped how I think about knowledge and community.  

I helped found [**Hamak‚Äôs Reading Club**](https://www.facebook.com/hamak.reading.club), where I served as head coordinator. Despite many restrictions, we created a space to openly discuss books, ideas, and films ‚Äî conversations that pushed boundaries and encouraged critical thought. Later, with **Cham‚Äôs Cultural Club**, I contributed as an organizer and eventually coordinated their reciprocal library initiative, which grew into seven locations across three Syrian governorates and was supported by a team of about 50 volunteers. I also joined discussions at **ALTC Cineclub**, adding film to the mix of cultural exchange. In parallel, I was contracted by the [**Syrian Trust for Development**](https://ich.unesco.org/en/accredited-ngos/accredited-ong-00761) to establish a book club at their premises ‚Äî a project I successfully launched.  

Books have always been central to my life. I‚Äôm especially drawn to series that open up entire worlds, such as Abdelrahman Munif‚Äôs *Cities of Salt*, Isaac Asimov‚Äôs *Foundation* series, and *Harry Potter*, each of which shaped my imagination in different ways. But no matter how much I read, as we say in Arabic, *‚Äúlove belongs to the first Habib‚Äù* ‚Äî for me, that first Habib was *Le Petit Prince*, my very first novel in first grade and the one I‚Äôve returned to in every language I‚Äôve learned, even French, which I never quite mastered.  

Photography and the arts are another personal passion. While I am far from being an artist myself, I‚Äôve attended art workshops by major Syrian artist, the late Ayman Aldakr, which gave me a lasting respect for visual expression and creativity. I also worked as an events photographer during my student days in Damascus.
