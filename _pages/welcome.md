# Welcome to My Personal Website  

I’m **Habib Zreik** — a mechanical engineer specializing in mechatronics. I'm into building, coding, and figuring out how complex systems fit together. Beyond engineering, I’ve always been drawn to community, culture, and volunteering.   

## Education


- ⏳ **M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering (specialization in Mechatronics)** — [University of Duisburg-Essen](https://www.uni-due.de/), 2023 – present (*thesis in progress*)  
- 🎓 **Associate Degree in Computer Science** — [University of the People](https://www.uopeople.edu/), 2023  
- ⏳ **MBA in Business Administration** — [Syrian Virtual University](https://www.svuonline.org/en), 2021 – present (*thesis pending*)
- 🎓 **B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering** — [Damascus University](https://www.damascusuniversity.edu.sy/index.php?lang=2), 2020
 

## Recent Work
Lately, at [**DST e.V.**](https://www.dst-org.de/), I have been working on the [**CoboTank**](https://cobotank.de/) project, which focuses on partially automating the liquid transshipment process from inland ports to tanker vessels. As part of this effort, I contributed to the development of the fully automated **RoboTank** system and co-authored a research paper presented at the [**IEEE International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications (MESA) 2025**](https://ieee-mesa.org/2025/) in Macau, China. **The paper**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11278877)The paper is available via IEEE Xplore. Alongside work, I am continuing my master’s studies in Mechatronics at the [**University of Duisburg-Essen**](https://www.uni-due.de/).


## What Drives My Work  

**🔧 Research & Robotics**  
I spent my days at DST contributing to maritime robotics and automation projects, developing software, and ensuring robotic systems are both reliable and intuitive.  

**📚 Sharing Knowledge**  
Since 2019, I’ve been part of **Bayt Al-Hikma 2.0** (Ideas Beyond Borders), translating and adapting technical and cultural content into Arabic. From mechanical engineering and sustainability to methodology and the history of ideas, I help make knowledge accessible to millions across the Middle East.  

**✍️ Writing & Documentation**  
Clear communication is key to everything I do. Whether I’m creating Git workflows for engineering teams, writing guides for robotics projects, or contributing to research publications, I aim to make complex ideas understandable and useful.  

## Areas of Expertise  

- **Mechanical & Mechatronic Engineering**: from classical mechanics to robotics and automation  
- **Programming**: C++, Python, ROS2  
- **Translation**: English ↔ Arabic technical, academic, and cultural works  
- **Research & Documentation**: scientific methodology, project development, technical writing  

## Beyond Engineering  

Alongside my technical and academic journey, I’ve been deeply involved in cultural initiatives that shaped how I think about knowledge and community.  

I helped found [**Hamak’s Reading Club**](https://www.facebook.com/hamak.reading.club), where I served as head coordinator. Despite many restrictions, we created a space to openly discuss books, ideas, and films — conversations that pushed boundaries and encouraged critical thought. Later, with **Cham’s Cultural Club**, I contributed as an organizer and eventually coordinated their reciprocal library initiative, which grew into seven locations across three Syrian governorates and was supported by a team of about 50 volunteers. I also joined discussions at **ALTC Cineclub**, adding film to the mix of cultural exchange. In parallel, I was contracted by the [**Syrian Trust for Development**](https://ich.unesco.org/en/accredited-ngos/accredited-ong-00761) to establish a book club at their premises — a project I successfully launched.  

Books have always been central to my life. I’m especially drawn to series that open up entire worlds, such as Abdelrahman Munif’s *Cities of Salt*, Isaac Asimov’s *Foundation* series, and *Harry Potter*, each of which shaped my imagination in different ways. But no matter how much I read, as we say in Arabic, *“love belongs to the first Habib”* — for me, that first Habib was *Le Petit Prince*, my very first novel in first grade and the one I’ve returned to in every language I’ve learned, even French, which I never quite mastered.  

Photography and the arts are another personal passion. While I am far from being an artist myself, I’ve attended art workshops by major Syrian artist, the late Ayman Aldakr, which gave me a lasting respect for visual expression and creativity. I also worked as an events photographer during my student days in Damascus.
